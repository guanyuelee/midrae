# MIDR-AE
![model of midrae](./midrae-model.png)
MIDR-AE (right) introduces Multidimensional Interpolation and Dual Regularizations to improve latent representations in autoencoders. 
Code for Improving representation learning in autoencoders via multidimensional interpolation and dual regularizations, which is accepted by (International Joint Conference of Artificial Intelligence) IJCAI 2019. 
## Requirements
Before running MIDR-AE, you need python==3.5.6 and the following python packages:
- cudnn==7.1.2
- numpy==1.15.2
- scipy==1.1.0
- tensorflow==1.8.0

For your ease, my conda environment is exported as file. You can easily restore the environment by typing command: 

    conda env create -f environment.yaml

It would take you about 30 minutes to download all necessary python packages.

## Preparing datasets
Specify the directory for saving your datasets by: 

    export AE_DATA=./Data

All the downloaded dataset would be save in './Data'. 

Before running the model, you should prepare dataset by executing: 

    python create_datasets.py

It would take a long time. So I also upload all the necessary files to my **Baidu Cloud**, please download all the *.tfrecord and save in './Data'. 

## Running the code

There are multiple base models:

- Baseline
- Denoising
- Dropout
- Variational AE
- VQVAE
- Adversarial AE
- ACAI

Our proposed model are listed as follows:
- MI-AE
- LR-AE
- DR-ACAI
- MIDR-AE

Find *.sh in **runs** directory, we have all optimal hyperparameters for various models specified there. Just run:

    bash runs/miae.sh
    bash runs/lrae.sh
    bash runs/dr_acai.sh
    bash runs/midrae.sh

You should be able to achieve the reported accuracy of single-layer classifier and clustering resuls:

You can also check the model checkpoints and intermediate images in directory './TRAIN'. 

## Results
Some of the results of MIDR-AE are shown are follows:

MNIST-32:
